# Vanna Framework RAG Model Example

This repository contains an example implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using the Vanna framework. The Vanna framework facilitates the connection between large language models and vector databases, enabling efficient and effective retrieval and generation processes.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models. By leveraging a vector database to retrieve relevant information and a large language model to generate responses, RAG models can provide more accurate and contextually appropriate outputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9
- Vanna framework
- A vector database (e.g., Faiss, Milvus)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vanna-rag-example.git
    cd vanna-rag-example
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

Before running the example, you need to configure the parameters in the configuration file (`config.py`). Update the parameters with your own settings:

```python
# config.py
